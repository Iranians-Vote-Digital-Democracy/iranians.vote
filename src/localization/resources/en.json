      {
        "q": "Which passport can be used for voting?",
        "a": "Only a foreign biometric passport whose validity does not expire on the voting date can be used. An ordinary passport cannot be used because verifying authenticity is too complex."
      },
      {
        "q": "What passport data is processed to create the voting credential?",
        "a": "Only the following data is used for voting registration: nationality; proof based on [Zero-Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) that you are over 18 at the time of voting; issuing authority certificate. Name, surname, date of birth and other personal data are not transmitted and remain only on your phone."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does anonymizing passport data mean?",
        "a": "When the passport is received after registration in the voting service, the passport data is hashed using a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) and [cryptographic salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)). This allows checking uniqueness of the passport without being able to trace voters' personal data."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can one know from passport data that a person registered to vote?",
        "a": "No, because the data is anonymized in the registration service (see above). Even with access to the entire passport database it is impossible to identify registered voters."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is blockchain and why is it used as the voting platform?",
        "a": "Simply put, a blockchain is a decentralized public database whose action history cannot be forged. It is suitable for voting because votes are practically impossible to fake and results are transparent and accessible to everyone."
      },
      {
        "q": "What kind of phone is suitable for scanning a passport?",
        "a": "To scan a passport you need an Android or iOS phone with an internal NFC chip (used for contactless payments)."
      },
      {
        "q": "Why hold the camera over the passport page if data is on the chip?",
        "a": "The passport data on the chip is encrypted and the app uses the code on the photo page to decrypt it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can a passport be forged during scanning?",
        "a": "To verify authenticity the system uses a public registry of issuing authorities (similar to systems in airports). Forging would require access to the issuing authority."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can it be determined which candidate an anonymous user voted for?",
        "a": "No, the user's vote is mixed with other votes in the election. Even the voter cannot later see who they voted for if they exit the app or delete it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Which blockchain is used for voting?",
        "a": "The [Rarimo](https://docs.rarimo.com/) protocol is used for identification and anonymization, and any EVM blockchain can be used for voting."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can someone vote twice with one passport but different phones?",
        "a": "No. During registration anonymized passport data is checked for uniqueness so double voting is impossible. Also, if you lose access to your phone after registering you cannot participate with another phone in the same vote."
      },
      {
        "q": "Who creates the vote and sets the list of candidates?",
        "a": "The organizer has the right to publish an online ballot with candidates which is then shown in the app. Malicious users cannot forge or spam the list of votes."
      },
      {
        "q": "Blockchain transactions cost fees; who pays for voting?",
        "a": "Fees are paid by a proxy server (the organizer) that builds and submits transactions to the network. The server cannot reveal voter identity or change their choice because the vote is protected by a cryptographic proof; any attempt to alter it invalidates the proof."
